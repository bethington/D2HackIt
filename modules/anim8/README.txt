anim8 1.0 for D2HackIt!

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This module lets you play animated messages over your head. Its a fun visual
effect, but completely useless from a hacking point of view :)

Commands:
  .anim8 play <animation>  - Plays <animation> from anim8.ini

Animations:
  You can create new animations by editing anim8.ini. Look at the included 
  animations to get the syntax.

  Included animations:
    .anim8 play dots
    .anim8 play trade
    .anim8 play police
    .anim8 play trade2
    .anim8 play loading (My personal favorite)
    
Installation:
  Copy anim8.d2h and anim8.ini to your D2HackIt folder and use ".load anim8" to 
  load the module.
