dupe3 and dclient 1.0 for D2HackIt!

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

These modules, when used together, would automate the dupe process using the
imbue-glitch to drop rings on the ground while in trade. Loading dupe3.d2h on 
one computer and dclient.d2h on another, you could initiate the dupe and go do 
something fun instead of spending time duping.

The actual duping goes on in dupe3, the dclient module is just a helper module 
to initiate trades over and over.

Included are the modules (dclient still works, dupe3 is useless) and the c++ 
source for those of you interested in how the dupe worked.

Note: This method will *NOT* work anymore, it has been fixed by blizzard.

Big thanks to the inventors for the details on how this dupe works.

Requirements:
  D2HackIt! 0.45 or later.
